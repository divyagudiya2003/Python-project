Bank Application using Python GUI 


Creating a simple banking application in Python with a GUI and database integration sounds like a great project! Hereâ€™s a basic outline to get you started:
1. Set up the GUI
Use libraries like tkinter to create the interface for registration, deposit, and withdrawal.
2. Design Database Tables
Use sqlite3 for a simple, file-based database.
Create a table with columns like username, password, account_number, balance, and optionally, phone_number.
3. Registration Process
The user fills in fields for username, password, account_number, and balance. You can add phone_number as optional.
Validate the input, then insert the data into the database.
Show a confirmation message for successful registration.
4. Deposit Process
Have the user enter their account_number and the deposit_amount.
Fetch the current balance, add the deposit amount, update the balance in the database, and show a "Deposited successfully" message.
5. Withdrawal Process
The user provides account_number and withdraw_amount.
Check if the account has enough balance, deduct the amount, update the database, and confirm with "Withdrawn successfully."
